1. Describe how you are feeling about the class.
 
  I feel comfortable and interested in this class. I like the way we learn in class and how we practice what we learned. I enjoy being in 
 this class because the answer's dont matter(whether they are right or wrong), how long it takes you to finish, whether it's fast or slow,
 doesn't matter as well. Overall computer science class is fun to be in.
 
2. Describe what we are learning and what you are learning

 Right now we are learning about "Circles of Evaluation" and how we can turn math expressions into code. The topic is very intriguing and amazing. The way we turn math expressions into circles of evaluation and then to code is really fun. The example with the ant is also really helpful when you want to turn the contents in the circles of evaluation into code. So far, I have learned how to put math expressions into cricles of evaluations and then tranfrom it into a way where the computer can understand it.
 
3. Describe any struggles or challenges that you are facing.

 A challenge that I have is totally grasping the concept of turning circles of evaluation into code. What I mean by totally grasping the topic is being able to do these problems with ease as if it were a simple addition problem. Right now, I have to take a good look at the circle(s) of evaluation and determine what the code will be and what order it will be in. I'm sure eventually I will overcome this challenge.
