1. Describe how you are feeling about the class.
 
  I feel comfortable and interested in this class. I like the way we learn in class and how we practice what we learned. I enjoy being in 
 this class because the answer's dont matter(whether it's right or wrong), how long it takes you to finish, whether it's fast or slow,
 doesn't matter as well. Overall computer science class is fun to be in.
