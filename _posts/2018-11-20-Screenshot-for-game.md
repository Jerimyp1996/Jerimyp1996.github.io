![Screenshot for game](/images/Screenshot for game.png)

This is a screenshot of the game that I am creating. The game consists of a robaot trying to get screws for his "body". The screws are the target and the water is the danger. You have to jump to collect the screws but then also try to avoid the water. It is basically the game "NinjaCat" but a little different.
