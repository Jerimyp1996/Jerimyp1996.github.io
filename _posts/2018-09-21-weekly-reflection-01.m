1. Describe your impressions of the class so far.
 My impressions of the class so far is that it is a very orginized and interesting class. Creating my own website was really fun and
 exciting. It makes me feel accomplished even though this is just the beggining of programming. The way we take notes too is very
 interesting and different but its a very helpful and orginized way of taking notes. I like it. Overall, I am very excited to
 learn more about Computer Science.
 
2. Describe what you have learned.
 I have learned how to create diffferent files and directories on Github. I also have learned how to creat a Github Website as well as
 learned about different markup "languages" like Markdown. In Github, if you want to create a new file in a certain dirrectory you'd have
 to put "the name of the directory" then a slash and then what you want to name the file. For example, for this post I did _posts/"name of
 the file". I'm pretty sure I got this down.
 
 3. Describe your biggest challenge.
  My biggest challenge was getting the link to my first post to work. I accidently forgot to change the date of the file so when I tried to
  type the file name into the URL (with the wrong date) it didn't work. I didnt know what was wrong until I saw the file and the date was
  wrong. The file then didnt let me edit it after a while. When I finally fixed the date to the file, I typed in the correct URL but it
  still didn't work. I hadn't realized that it takes a while for the post to go up... Eventually my first post was up.
