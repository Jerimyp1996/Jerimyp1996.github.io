## Flag of United Kingdom by Jerimy Perez

## Describe your program

-   What country did you design for? _then delete this instruction_
-   What grade do you expect? _then delete this instruction_

I designed a Flag for the United Kingdom. I made the United Kingdom flag pretty geometrically accurate and eye pleasing. Therefore, I think that I deserve at least a practitioner for my effort on the Flag and the scaling part. Although the scaling part does work, two triangles are always out of place. This was obviusly not intended but I think that because the other shapes work(and because of my attempt at this), I should get at least a practitioner for this Flag project.
