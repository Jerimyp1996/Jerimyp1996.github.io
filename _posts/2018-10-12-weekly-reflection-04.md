# Part 1:Our Learning

 This week, we all learned and participated in a certain activity. We learnd about "Definitions",in the context of code, and we worked togther as pairs to code different types of shapes that were both complex and simple. A definition is a certain keyword that you set to an example of a contact so when you want to "make" the example of the contract, you would just have to type in the keyword. For example, the conract for a red star goes as follows: (star 50 "solid" "red"). If you want to type in the red star code again but more efficently and faster, you would define the code to a keyword. It could be any key word you want. Let's say my keyword is "BOB". To set the keyword you would type this in: (define BOB(star 50 "solid" "red")). That would make it so that when you type in "BOB", a red star would appear. This week, we also did "Pair Programming". Each pair would work on creating functions for the images that we were given. Some were simple, but others were a bit more complex. Some had shapes inside of shapes. Overall, one connection I see is that there are faster and more efficient ways of writing code. There are probably even more "shortcuts" that we have yet to learn.

# Part 2:My Learning

 This week, I learned not only about Definitions but I also learned somehting from the activity, "Pair Programming". From this activity, I learned that working with another person, even if you're both confused helps a lot better than working alone and being confused. Working with another person helps solve problems more efficiently. This is from past experience. My partner and I suggested many different ways of solving a problem and eventually we did solve it. Hvaing another mind to work with is better than being alone. This was one of the challenges I faced; creating a function that would match the picture given to us. But as I said before, we were able to create one and finish eventaully by working together.
