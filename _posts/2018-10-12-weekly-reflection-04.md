# Part 1:Our Learning

 This week, we all learned and participated in a certain activity. We learnd about "Definitions",in the context of code, and we worked togther as pairs to code different types of shapes that were both complex and simple. A definition is a certain keyword that you set to an example of a contact so when you want to "make" the example of the contract, you would just have to type in the keyword. For example, the conract for a red star goes as follows: (star 50 "solid" "red"). If you want to type in the red star code again but more efficently and faster, you would define the code to a keyword. It could be any key word you want. Let's say my keyword is "BOB". To set the keyword you would type this in: (define BOB(star 50 "solid" "red")). That would make it so that when you type in "BOB", a red star would appear. This week, we also did "Pair Programming". Each pair would work on creating functions for the images that we were given. Some were simple, but others were a bit more complex. Some had shapes inside of shapes.
