So far in the semester, we have learned about many different things which incude; learning about the web and Github pages(how to operate and create files in Github), we learned about math expressions and how to turn them into code that the computer will understand, using the  of cricles of evaluation method. We laso learned about many different HTML Tags and what they do. In addition to this, we aslo applied contracts(in the context of code) to our Flag project. Some students also applied definitions to the contracts to make it easier when using large amounts of code. Earlier this week, we startd working on our first video game project. The arguments in a contract example change the outcome of the value and/or image. We worked together as pairs to change the code of our M.W.E for our video game in order to change the images that were there and have our own desired images.
