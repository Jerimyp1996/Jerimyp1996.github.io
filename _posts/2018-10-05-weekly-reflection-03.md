 Describe how you are feeling about the class.
 
 I am enjoying my time in the class so far. It is a positive and engaging learning experience. The stuff that we participate in and the stuff that we learn is really interesting and fun to me as well. Going to Computer Science class is always an interesting feeling since I know that we will learn or do something interesting and fun to me. On Friday, we did a little something different than coding. We made flags out of paper and drawings which was fun to me. It's supposed to relate to the contracts that we make in code. This leads to what we learned in class...
 
 Describe what we are learning and what you are learning.

 We are learning about HTML tags and contracts. An HTML tag is a type of text that you put as an "intro" or an "outro" in code. For example for a paragraph, you would put "< p >" and then "</ p >" at the end. Inbetween those tags you woud put your text. I also learned about contracts in the context of code. In Racket(a type of programming language) we write general Contracts like this: ";(function): (number) (number) -> (number)". These contracts are moslty used for writing expressions in code. An example of this contract would be: "(+ 2 3)" which would then come out to 5. Another type of contract in Racket goes like this: ";(function): (number) (string) (string) -> (image)" These types of contracts are used for creating shapes or images. An example of this contract would be: (star 50 "solid" "blue"). The "functions", in this case the shapes and operations, also have "arguments". The arguments would be "number" and "string" or "2","3","50","solid" and "blue". These arguments should be in the specific order that is mentioned in the shapes/images contract example. If the arguments aren't in that specific order, the compter won't recognize what you are trying to do. I like this material and I find it interesting.
 
 Describe any struggles or challenges that you are facing.
 
  A challenge that I am facing right now is getting to school/class on time. The thing is that I don't sleep early so I don't wake up early. The train delays then add to the problem. Since most of the time Computer Science class is first period, I am sometimes late. I need to start sleeping and waking up early consistently.
