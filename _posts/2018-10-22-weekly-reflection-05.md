# Part 1: Our Learning

 This week, we learned about several different image-function contracts. Some of these contracts were used when we created our M.W.E(Minimal Working Example) of our flag. These contracts can create many different shapes of many different sizes. Some images had shapes inside of shapes. The put-image function allowed for this to happen too. After this, at the end of the week, we submitted the code for our "Flag Project Version 0" for the flag that we chose. One connection that I see is that we learned about the "put-image" function last week so that we could get a jist of what it does and apply it to our flags this week.
 
# Part 2: My Learning

 I chose the Mexican Flag as the flag that I wanted to create. I chose this flag because it's where I'm from. At the beginning of creating my flag, it was pretty hard. I first made the base which was a wide green rectangle. The Mexican Flag has three main parts; the green part(which is on the left), the white part with the eagle(which is in the middle), and the red part (which is on the right). After I had my base down, I added the white part to the middle using another put-image function. I then did the same with the red part. These white and red parts covered the excess green to match the flag. I then realized that the white part in the middle is less wide then the parts on the side. Because of this, I proceeded to make the red and green sides bigger in order for the white to appear smaller. After all this tweaking, I finally completed my M.W.E for my flag. The only thing that's left is importing the eagle onto the flag which is my challenge because I don't know how to do it yet. In closing, I learned how to apply and combine many different functions in order to make a specific desired image.
