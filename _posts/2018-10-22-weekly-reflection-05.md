# Part 1: Our Learning

 This week, we learned about several different image-function contracts. Some of these contracts were used when we created our M.W.E(Minimal Working Example) of our flag. These contracts can create many different shapes of many different sizes. Some images had shapes inside of shapes. The put-image function allowed for this to happen too. After this, at the end of the week, we submitted the code for our "Flag Project Version 0" for the flag that we chose. One connection that I see is that we learned about the "put-image" function last week so that we could get a jist of what it does and apply it to our flags.
