Question #3 was question that assessed Mastery skill #1. It was a novice question that 50% of 106 total students that took the test got correct. this means that 53 students got Question #3 correct. Mastery skill #1 was about "using tools", meaning that mastery skill #1 required you to either evaluate expressions, interpret contracts, create applications or create test questions. This question  was question #1 on version 1 and question #6 on version 2 on the Midterm Exam. the question looked something like this...

# What is the vale of the 3rd argument of the innermost function in the expression below?

```scale(2, circle(40, "solid", 'blue"))

(a) 2 (b) 40 (c) "solid" (d) "blue"
```

The correct answer for this question is (d) "blue" the second most chosen answer was (c) "solid". C was the second most chosen answer because studnets probablky thought that they could just count the words, and put the third word as the answer. The third word was "solid" so students most likel;y assumed that taht was the third argument of the innermost function. The actual third argument of the innermost function is "blue". ther are two functions in this expression; Sclae and circle. For Scale, the argument is 2 and the image that follows; circle 40 'solid" "blue". teh circle is also the second function of the expression with its arguments being; 40, "solid" "blue". Since the function scale is surrounding the circle function, it is considdred the outermost function, making the circle the innermost function. The third argument of circle is 'blue" so (d) is the correct answer.
