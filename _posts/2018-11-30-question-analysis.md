Question #3 was a question that assessed Mastery skill #1. It was a novice question that 50% of 106 total students that took the test got correct. This means that 53 students got Question #3 correct. Mastery skill #1 was about "using tools", meaning that mastery skill #1 required you to either evaluate expressions, interpret contracts, create applications, create test questions or use your knowledge of contracts and functions to solve the problem. This question was question #1 on Version 1 and question #6 on Version 2 of the Midterm Exam. The question goes as follows...

# What is the vale of the 3rd argument of the innermost function in the expression below?

```scale(2, circle(40, "solid", 'blue"))

(a) 2 (b) 40 (c) "solid" (d) "blue"
```

The correct answer for this question is (d) "blue" and the second most chosen answer was (c) "solid". C was the second most chosen answer because students probably thought that they could just count the words, and put the third word as the answer. The third word was "solid" so students most likely assumed that that was the third argument of the innermost function. The actual third argument of the innermost function is "blue". There are two functions in this expression; Scale and circle. For Scale, the argument is 2 and the image that follows; circle 40 'solid" "blue". Circle is also the second function of the expression with its arguments being; 40, "solid", and "blue". Since the function ,scale, is surrounding the circle function, it is considered the outermost function, making the circle the innermost function. The third argument of circle is 'blue" so (d) is the correct answer.
