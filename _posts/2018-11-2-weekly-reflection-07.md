Throughout this week, we learned about a certain concept called "Function Definitions". In order to understand and apply a function definition, we first have to understand what a contract is. A contract is the structure of any specific function. The contract guides and "tells" the programmer what to type and code into the function application. In a Function appplication you define any function, that you create or already exists, to another function. You then add an argument to the fucntion,(Example: Size,Color) so that when you type the function with the specific size, or color, that you want, the specific function that you defined will apear with that string. This makes it easier because then all you have to type is the keyword(function that you created) and a string and then an image will apear.
