# Part 1 - My Flag

 The flag that I chose to work on is the United Kindom Flag. The flag is twice as wide as it is high. The width of the flag is 60 units while the height of the flag is 30 units. There are 4 imaginary rectangular figures in the corners that contain other shapes. This shape is 25 units wide and 10 units in height. There are also 2 small vertical rectangles which are 2 units wide each. In the middle of the flag, there is a big red rectangle which is 6 units wide. There are many different shapes on the flag such as triangles, rectangles and an odd shape that looks likle a rectangle that was slightly cut off wiht something sharp at the end of it. These can be thought about as different layers on top of each other. One way you can look at the flag is that it has a white background wiht different colored shapes on top. Since all the shapes are seperated, the flag can be thought of as having two layers. The Union Jack Flag (United Kindom Flag) Consists of the colors, Dark blue, Dark Red and white.
