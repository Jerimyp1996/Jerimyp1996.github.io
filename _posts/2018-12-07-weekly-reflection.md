# Part 1 - My Flag


[!union jack](/images/union jack.png)

 The flag that I chose to work on is the United Kindom Flag(as shown above). The flag is twice as wide as it is high. The width of the flag is 60 units while the height of the flag is 30 units. There are 4 imaginary rectangular figures in the corners that contain other shapes. This imaginary rectangle is 25 units wide and 10 units in height. There are also 2 small vertical rectangles which are 2 units wide each. In the middle of the flag, there is a big red rectangle which is 6 units wide. There are many different shapes on the flag such as triangles, rectangles and an odd shape that looks like a rectangle that was slightly cut off with something sharp at the end of it. These can be thought about as different layers on top of each other. One way you can look at the flag is that it has a white background with different colored shapes on top. Since all the shapes are separated, the flag can be thought of as having two layers. The white background, and the shapes on top of it. This can often help when you are writing the code for it. You can make a white background and position certain shapes on it to form the United Kingdom Flag. The Union Jack Flag (United Kindom Flag) also consists of the colors, Dark blue, Dark Red and white.
 # Part 2: Questions/Challenges
 
 One challenge that I am facing right now is that I don't know what shape is going diagonally through the flag. It seems like a rectangle that has been sliced at the top but what would that shapes name be in wescheme? Perhaps I would have to create a rectangle but then slightly cover the top with white so that it appears to be cut at the end. I think that that is the only problem that I am facing right now before I actually start to code it. The shapes and its positions seem fairly understandable but will take a lot of trials and errors to complete. Other than that, I think that more challenges will appear to me as I start to create and code the Flag rather than before.
